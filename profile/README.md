# AvdanDOE

Your experience is bein' cooked. And you can watch it too.

## A decent frontend

Finally, making Linux usable for you. With nearly all the goodies you saw in the original concept by Avdan, and maybe even a bit more, we're striving to deliver the best experience possible. But in the meantime, here are some frequently asked questions, and answers to them.

### DE or Distro?

AvdanDOE is a distributive, based on Arch Linux, it comes with the best of the rolling release, with bleeding edge updates, and no EOL.

### Licensing and contribution

Keep in mind that until the **beta** release, all of the code and configuration is licensed under CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0, prohibiting any modifications unless stated otherwise. Refer to LICENSE.md per repository for more info.

The project will be licensed under GNU GPLv3 after full release.

### ETA

Unknown, but the first preview/alpha release (which is, just in case you wanted to, is likely not suitable for everyday use) should not take too long to come.
