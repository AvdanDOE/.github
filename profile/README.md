### FAQ

#### DE or Distro?

AvdanDOE is a Linux distribution based on Arch Linux. It comes with the best parts of a rolling release base, with bleeding edge updates, and (theoretically) no End-Of-Life.

#### Licensing and contribution

Keep in mind that until the **beta** release, all of the code and configuration is licensed under CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0, prohibiting any modifications unless stated otherwise. Refer to LICENSE.md per repository for more info.

The project will be licensed under GNU GPLv3 after full release.

#### ETA

We already have a POC ISO! Look in Discord/Telegram to download it, and stay tuned for more!
